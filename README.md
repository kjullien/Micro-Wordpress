# Micro Wordpress Plugin

This plugin allows you to create micro-services with PHP and Wordpress (just like zeit/micro)
It is very small and tries to be intuitive.

## Usage
What I do is keep the files in this repo in my `mu-plugins` folder.
You're free to do it any other way you can possibly come up with although.

(More doc to come eventually)
